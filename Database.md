## Difference between MySQL and PostgreSQL

-----------------------------------------------------
| MySQL | PostgreSQL    |
|-------|---------------|
| It is one of the most famous, open-source Relational database management systems (RDMS). The data in this table is stored in tables which makes it easy to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete)  | It is a powerful, open-source Object-relational database system. It provides good performance with low maintenance efforts because of its high stability.PostgreSQL was the first DBMS that implemented the multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) feature.
| Fast, easy, and reliable. Can be used for both large and small applications. Provides high scalability    | Some of the highlights of PostgreSQL are:  Support for the vast amount of languages. It provides advanced security features. It has geo-tagging support.
| MySQL is a pure relational database (RDBMS). | PostgreSQL is an object-relational database (ORDBMS) 
| It doesn’t provide support for Materialised views and Table inheritance. | PostgreSQL provides both of them.
| It is reliable, simple, and faster.   | It is slower and more complex.
| 	It is best suitable for simple operations like write and reading.   | It is commonly used for large and complex operations.
| Do you need a simpler database that’s easy to set up and manage, fast, reliable, and well-understood? MySQL is ideal.     | Do you need a feature-rich database that can handle complex queries and massive databases? Postgres could be your choice thanks to its scalability.
| Supported Data Types: Numeric ,Date/time ,Character ,JSON ,Boolean ,Enumerated ,XML ,Geometric ,Arrays ,Ranges ,Network address ,HSTOREComposite | Numeric, Date/time, Character, JSON, Spatial
